User NavBar React Project
Overview
This project is a simple React application featuring a responsive navigation bar. The navigation bar includes a dynamic user section displaying a username and avatar, a theme changer toggle (light/dark mode), and is designed to be mobile-friendly. On smaller screens, the navigation links are accessible via a hamburger menu, and the user's avatar is hidden for a cleaner UI.

Features
#Responsive Navigation Bar: Adapts to various screen sizes with a mobile-friendly design.
#User Information: Fetches and displays a user's name and avatar from an API.
#Theme Toggle: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
#Mobile Adaptability: Uses a hamburger menu on mobile devices and hides the avatar for better display.
Technologies Used
React: Frontend library for building UI components.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to fetch user data.
CSS: For styling, including responsive design with media queries.

# User NavBar React Project

## Overview

This project is a simple React application featuring a responsive navigation bar. The navigation bar includes a dynamic user section displaying a username and avatar, a theme changer toggle (light/dark mode), and is designed to be mobile-friendly. On smaller screens, the navigation links are accessible via a hamburger menu, and the user's avatar is hidden for a cleaner UI.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar:** Adapts to various screen sizes with a mobile-friendly design.
- **User Information:** Fetches and displays a user's name and avatar from an API.
- **Theme Toggle:** Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Mobile Adaptability:** Uses a hamburger menu on mobile devices and hides the avatar for better display.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Frontend library for building UI components.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to fetch user data.
- **CSS:** For styling, including responsive design with media queries.
